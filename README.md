Scoring software for ESPN ALPS API.

This was our entry for the ESPN ALPS API Contest.  Details are here: http://espnalps.com/details (link live as of 1/15/2015).

It was the first reasonable sized C# application that we wrote, coming from backgrounds in Java/Python/C.  We worked on this while taking full computer science courseloads, and on a fairly tight deadline.  The code is therefore not the cleanest we've written--but we're still proud of it.

We enjoyed working on it, as we are all big college basketball fans.

Our application won the first place prize of $5,000. As the contest flyer noted, "that buys a lot of pizza."  We don't maintain this in any manner, it's posted here for posterity's sake.
